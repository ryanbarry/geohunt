GeoHunt
=======
This was my final project in CS176B - Intro to Networking 2. The project was
split into two parts, 1) a mobile phone application running on Android or
Windows Phone 7 that connected to a game server for a geo-caching game; and 2)
the server, of course. I picked the server and developed it to run on Google App
Engine, using a framework called Tipfy. There is an instance running at
[cs176b.appspot.com](http://cs176b.appspot.com), though it is less interesting
without a the mobile client. (psst! if you put "/admin" at the end of the url
you can get into the administration interface without a password...)
